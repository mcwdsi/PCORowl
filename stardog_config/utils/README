The Makefile is designed to speed up development with Stardog. Place the Makefile in the stardog/bin directory and run it from there. Note that the Makefile assumes your PCORowl directory is located at the same level as your stardog directory.


PCORowl
│   └── stardog_config
│       └── utils
│           └── Makefile copy to--+
└── stardog			  |
    └── bin			  |
        └── Makefile <------------+

The add_cols.py script is used to add the necessary columns to store the pre-generated values for the URIs created by the Stardog mapping file. This also modifies the RACE values to add 100 responses of '07', or Refused to Answer.
